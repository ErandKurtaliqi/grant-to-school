## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **preprocessing and preparation of educational grant data** for students in classes 6–10.  
The dataset provides insights into year-wise grants distributed to school students, serving as a foundation for future data analysis and machine learning tasks.

In this phase, we have performed **comprehensive data preprocessing** to ensure data quality, integrity, and readiness for analytical modeling.

## Major Tasks in Data Preprocessing

### 1. Data Cleaning
We focused on improving data quality and consistency through:
- Filling in **missing values** using appropriate imputation techniques;
- **Smoothing noisy data** to remove irregularities and inconsistencies;
- Identifying and removing **outliers** that distort the dataset;
- Resolving **inconsistencies** in naming, formatting, and categorical labels.

### 2. Data Reduction
To optimize performance and storage, we applied several data reduction techniques:
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Removed redundant or less significant attributes;
- **Numerosity Reduction:** Aggregated and summarized data to reduce record count while maintaining essential information;
- **Data Compression:** Utilized encoding and compact formats to minimize data size.

### 3. Data Transformation & Discretization
We transformed and standardized data to make it more suitable for analysis:
- **Normalization:** Scaled numeric features to a common range for better comparison;
- **Concept Hierarchy Generation:** Grouped attributes into meaningful hierarchies (e.g., year ranges, class categories);
- **Data Discretization:** Converted continuous data into categorical bins to simplify analysis.

### 4. Data Aggregation
After preprocessing, **data aggregation** was performed to derive summarized views —  
combining records by year, class, and gender to identify overall trends and funding patterns.

## Objectives
- Clean, structure, and prepare the dataset for future analysis.
- Enable efficient visualization and trend identification.
- Build a solid base for predictive modeling and grant distribution optimization.
